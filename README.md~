In Progress
-Counterattack -> Hunters
	-A townsperson has a (1/2)(num of alive werewolves/number of players) to rebluff a werewolf attack and kill the werewolf [implemented]
	-This person becomes a Hunter and can attack any alive person at night - the chance to kill is .5(1 - (num of Hunters/num of alive 			Townpersons) 
	-If he kills a townsperson, the Hunter also dies
-Restarting the game if admin

To Do
-Keep track of Players' last reportLocation in Player; in case the server goes down, the game keeps track that the Player has reported in
-End game status, complete with updating score
-For scores, display only the scores as they were before the game began; scores continue to increment but do not visually update until end of game
-Achievements, linked to User
-Images
-Registering + adding/removing Users
-Last will and testament - when killed, townsperson has a 0.1 chance of identitifying his attacker to a nearby townsperson
